        Our integrations allow you to invite your customer automatically for leaving a review. You can decide whenever you want these invitations to go out. How easy is that?

        **Show your review rating on your webshop**

        With this plugin our sidebar shows your combined rating directly on your shop. Meaning your webshop visitor does not have to leave your shop to see the collected reviews! Other presentation items you can add to your webshop using html code.
